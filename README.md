Real-time Recommendation System
Overview
This project focuses on building a real-time recommendation system to provide personalized suggestions based on user behavior and preferences. The system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze past interactions and predict relevant recommendations.

Features
✅ User-based and item-based recommendations
✅ Real-time data processing for dynamic suggestions
✅ Machine learning models for accurate predictions
✅ Scalable architecture for handling large datasets

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Machine Learning (Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering)
Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Databases (SQL/NoSQL for storing user interactions)

Usage
Input user interactions (clicks, purchases, ratings).
The system processes data and generates personalized recommendations.
Results are displayed as a list of suggested items.
Future Enhancements
Integration with deep learning models (Transformers, Neural Networks)
Improved recommendation accuracy using hybrid models
Deployment as a web application or API
